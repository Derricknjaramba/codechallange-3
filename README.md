Flatdango Movie Ticket Booking App
Learning Goals
Implement a 'mini' web application using JavaScript.

Introduction
Flatdango is a web application that simulates a movie ticket booking system for Flatiron Movie Theater. Users can view movie details, purchase tickets, and interact with a menu of available movies.

Requirements
Have a well-written README file.
Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.
Pre-requisite Data
You can use this JSON file for your server DB.

Project Setup
Create a new project folder.
Create a new GitHub repository (ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
Add your TM as a contributor to the project for grading purposes.
Regularly commit changes to the repository.
Project Guidelines
Your project should adhere to the following guidelines:

Core Deliverables:
As a user, I can:

See the first movie's details, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets when the page loads. The available tickets are derived by subtracting tickets_sold from capacity.
See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the ul#films element when the page loads.
Buy a ticket for a movie, with frontend updates showing the decrease in available tickets. No persistence is required for this feature.
Bonus Deliverables:
Click on a movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's details with the new movie's details.
Indicate a movie as "Sold Out" in the menu and disable ticket purchases when no tickets are available.
Implement fetch requests (POST, PATCH, DELETE) to update data on the json-server backend for more advanced interactions.

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Navigate to the project folder.
Open index.html in your browser to view the application.
